## RELEASE PROJECT DATA

'Tribe' is a first transmedia narrative chapter from the storyworld of Hitech Crime made by Helve AVR high technology agency. This marks the prototyping phase being actualized. Let the audiovisual experiments begin. This one relates close to my heart as it deals with the main overarching theme that has been present in my life - the notion of belonging to a tribe. Study on the feeling of loss, loyalty, discovery, selfrealization and mastery.

This story is a paraphrase of what I went through life. I was undermining myself by trying to fit in anywhere it was possible.
Metaphor of loyalty changes, selfdestructive blind behaviour as i couldn't cope with what i was feeling, mind games, betrayals, deception, real life.

This is going to be one song single + surrounding material.

## MAIN NARRATIVE

**Main Narrative**
Story based on lyrics of the single album release.

```
"With gold come knots tied on tight klout calls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer flaws"
```
```
With gold
```
- a job that gave the tribe a money stash, initial success theme, overwhelming feeling of power
```
come knots tied on tight
```
- having wealth always backfires / consumptionism / capitalism, feeling of loss
```
klout calls
```
- it makes people and their friends change usually for the worse if you don't know how to apply the power of wealth, people start making problems, loyalty theme
```
for blood
```
- own blood turns against blood of the tribe, people start making problems blinded with the prospect of benefits, betrayal, disappointment, mystery, violent delights, loyalty theme, wealth acquired disappears, blame is being assigned to the girl protagonist (seemingly for a reason, evidence is undeniable).
- death of a tribe member, girl protagonist the main character loves but at first doesn't realize she helped to conspire against him and the tribe to achieve benefits at cost of the others. she dies, he feels grief but discovers a clue that leads to discovery that she was having doubts about what is going on (their plan? someone external? nemesis of the story?) this and was being coerced into doing this along with the male protagonist. this begins the arc of revenge. 

Different perspective of the same story revealed through different platform (perspective of the girl):

- it in fact was the protagonist who mainly wanted to steal the stash, she and him were controlled remotely with an implant through a hacked Tribe's sign in form of a Photon Tattoo permalighted on skin (can be torn from flesh tho -> # -//-) and didn't know (blackouts), main character kills the girl he loved thinking he is trying to save the tribe, unknowingly being the trigger for the whole thing that started it all.

- Video short/animated as a part of the instagram release 9post: sensory scene - the dying girl, what she feels and hears in the audio comms as she is dying. Blue light from the street neons shines on her face. Vision distorts as she thinks "what did i do to deserve this?" (echoing voice in the video) not knowing it was her who instigated/helped with the incident "what's going on?" as she wakes up from a blackout and realizes that her life is in shreds. culmination - electric explosion - overloaded street generator with a rain of sparks hiting the pavement
```
sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
```
- downfall of morals and loyalty, need to express anger and resentment, learning to cope, lashing out
```
my tribe uses doubt and fear
```
- forced selfdiscovery
```
to conquer flaws
```
- which in the end turns out to be beneficial to the initially unaware. mastery theme

**FULL LYRICS TEXT**
```
hitech crime (electronic voice, glitch, 
GLADOS style but with darkness)

like buzzing electricity from neons*

"learned a lesson, your turn"

HOOK (coming up)

With gold come knots tied on tight klout calls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer flaws 

CHORUS (drop)

With gold come knots tied on tight klout calls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer flaws 

INTERMISSION

Wounds
Reversed the costs at the speed of flow
aye

CHORUS

With gold come knots tied on tight klout calls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer flaws 

INTERMISSION

Fear(?) in the eyes of the public
When I drop the bombs with...

CHORUS (lower chilled scream)

With gold come knots tied on tight klout calls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer flaws 

VERSE

Landlines filled with blots
I slide off,  what everybody does,

....

anybody knows 
that I tend to search for costs
usually chunks of soul

CHORUS

With gold come knots tied on tight klout calls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer flaws 

blargh

OUTRO

*electric explosion - overloaded street generator with sparks 
hiting the pavement ;p not sure just yet, 
everything can be changed to fit a mutual vision*

///

With gold so thoughts bring the light from souls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer all

## PROJECT DATA

'Tribe' is a first transmedia narrative chapter from the storyworld of Hitech Crime made by Helve AVR high technology agency. This marks the prototyping phase being actualized. Let the audiovisual experiments begin. This one relates close to my heart as it deals with the overarching theme that has been present in my life - the notion of belonging to a tribe. Study on the feeling of loss, loyalty, discovery, selfrealization and mastery.

This is going to be one song single + surrounding material.

HOOK (coming up)

With gold come knots tied on tight klout calls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer flaws 

CHORUS (drop)

With gold come knots tied on tight klout calls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer flaws 

INTERMISSION

Wounds
Reversed the costs at the speed of flow
aye

CHORUS

With gold come knots tied on tight klout calls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer flaws 

INTERMISSION

Fear(?) in the eyes of the public
When I drop the bombs with...

CHORUS (lower chilled scream)

With gold come knots tied on tight klout calls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer flaws 

VERSE

Landlines filled with blots
I slide off,  what everybody does,

....

anybody knows 
that I tend to search for costs
usually chunks of soul

CHORUS

With gold come knots tied on tight klout calls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer flaws 

blargh

OUTRO

*electric explosion - overloaded street generator with sparks hiting the pavement ;p not sure just yet, everything can be changed to fit a mutual vision*

///

With gold so thoughts bring the light from souls
For blood, sacrifice darkness to the rap gods
My tribe uses doubt and fear to conquer all
